## Design

Initially, this website was supposed to only have one page with the content starting from home page and the other pages in that order, but was made into multiple pages each dedicated to a different subject so it would not be cluttered. The content for Great Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls, home page and sign up page was all different so it made sense to have a page dedicated with different styling. It also makes it easier as time goes and updates need to be made, to add them to their respective existing pages and create new ones with different themes for other new places. 

## Images

The images were found on Unsplash, Pexel and greatzimbabwe.com and the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority page.

## Colors

Not only do the green and yellow that colors are used match well with pictures of nature, but are also on the Zimbabwean flag. Initially white was going to be used, but a decision was made to use an off-white instead for backgrounds where there are no images.

## Fonts

"Pt Sans Narrow" is used for logo and headings and "Raleway" for paragraphs. Visually these fonts seem to go better together compared to "Josefin Sans" that was previously used for the logo and header, it seemed too serious for a website that's suggesting adventure and fun.
