                        This monument full of history known for its large circular wall and tower provides a
                        perfect day out for visitors in Zimbabwe. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, which was a Shona (Bantu) trading empire during
                        the country’s Late Iron Age. It was part of a wealthy African trading empire that controlled much of the East African coast from the 11th to the 15th centuries C.E. Great Zimbabwe served as a royal palace for the Zimbabwean monarch
                        and was used as the seat of political power. One of its most prominent features were the walls,
                        some of which were over five meters high and which were constructed without mortar and are still
                        standing to this day.

                        There are eight birds carved in soapstone that were found in the ruins of
                        Great Zimbabwe.These eight sculptures combine both human and bird elements. For instance, the bird’s beak is
                        substituted by lips while its claws are changed to feet.It is unsure what the birds symbolized. The most prevalent theory is that they were the emblems
                        of the royalty. Today, the soapstone birds can be found on the Zimbabwean flag.
